# A custom agent that combines different strategies and changes between them based on time
# At first the agent enters an exploration phase where it acts as a very strict random walker
# After the exploration phase the agent starts behaving like the Agreeable agent, picking bids based on minimum
# utility and roulette selection based on social welfare
# After that, if the agents still did not find an agreement, the agent will start looking for the best nash product
# Lastly the agent will start sending bids that it already received, maximizing its utility

    The Shreker agent is an agent that changes its strategy depending on the time in the following order:

    - Social welfare: late into the negotiation optimizes social welfare if opponent still has not conceded much
    - Received bids: very late into the negotiation return one of the best bids out of the 20 last received bids
