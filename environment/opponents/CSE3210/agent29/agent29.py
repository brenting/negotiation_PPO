    Agent Hope

                Linear concession is used for target utilities.

                Each time a bid is to be chosen, a whole range of bids close to the target utility is considered from
                which, the ones with values closest to the estimated opponent's preferred values are prioritised for
                the final offer.

                Close to the deadline, the agent offers the bid with the highest utility from the set of all the bids
                received.

                Bids are accepted only if the are sufficiently better than the average received bid.
                This approach only accepts very good bids and only becomes more lenient towards the very end of
                negotiation.

                It is ensured that no bid with utility lower than the agent's reservation value
                is ever offered or accepted.
